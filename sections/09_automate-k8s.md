# Hands-On: Automating the deployment to Kubernetes

When we take the next step in our automation journey, we move from continous delivery to continous deployment. 

This would require a kubernetes cluster for us to be able to add a stage or a job to our pipeline to automatically deploy our application to Kubernetes. With GitLab we can integrate a Kubernetes cluster with our project e.g. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), where you can link your Google account to GitLab or other, even already exisiting clusters as well.

In this Hands-On we can not provide a cluster for everyone to try this, but we encourage you to take the next step and set up an integration to automatically deploy an app to a cluster.

A great starting point is the free Google Cloud Trial which can be used for 90 days and includes $300 of free credits to use on the platform, spinning up your first own cluster and get an integration up to delpoy from a pipeline.
