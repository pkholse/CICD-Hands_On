# Hands-On: Automating the deployment to Kubernetes

When we take the next step in our automation journey, we can go from continous delivery to continous deployment. This would require a kubernetes cluster for us to be able to add a stage or a job to our pipeline to automatically deploy our application to Kubernetes. With GitLab we can integrate a Kubernetes cluster with our project e.g. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), where you can link your Google account to GitLab or other, even already exisiting clusters as well.
In this Hands-On we can not provide a cluster for everyone to try this, but we encourage you to take the next step and set up an integration to automatically deploy an app to a cluster.
